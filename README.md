# Fixed6x13-dotted-zero
Popular Fixed Width X11 font with dotted zero

This is a bit modified version of one of the fixed-width fonts distributed with X11, 6x13.bdf. The original font can be found here: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html

The original font did not have dotted zero, this modification is solely for that.

For Mac, use FixedMedium.dfont
For Windows, use FixedMedium.fon

##Known Issues:
1. For Windows, programs like PuTTY, may recognize the font as variable-width font. But, it does not cause any issue in font rendering.

##Credits:
1. I used FontForge to generate fonts from bdf: https://fontforge.github.io
2. I had to use Simon Tatham's scripts to regenerate .fon file, because somehow Windows 10 does not recognize .fon generated by FontForge: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/fonts/
